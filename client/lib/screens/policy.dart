By using the App, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy, you should discontinue use of the Service.\n\nWe are committed to protecting your privacy and designing our Service with security and data minimization as core principles. The App is designed so that your sensitive information, including passwords and secure notes, remains private and inaccessible to anyone other than you.\n\nInformation We Collect\n\nThe App may collect limited information necessary to provide and improve the Service. This includes information you voluntarily provide, such as an email address or account identifier if you choose to create an account, contact support, or enable optional features. We do not require you to provide personal information beyond what is necessary for basic functionality.\n\nThe App stores encrypted user data locally on your device or in secure storage, depending on the configuration you choose. This data may include passwords, usernames, secure notes, and other information you choose to store. All such data is encrypted before storage and cannot be read by us.\n\nWe may automatically collect certain non-identifying technical information, such as device type, operating system version, application version, and general usage data. This information is used solely for improving performance, diagnosing issues, and ensuring compatibility, and it does not include the contents of your stored passwords or sensitive vault data.\n\nHow We Use Information\n\nWe use collected information only for purposes directly related to operating and improving the Service. This includes maintaining app functionality, providing customer support, responding to inquiries, fixing bugs, and enhancing security features. We may also use limited technical data to analyze usage trends and improve user experience.\n\nYour encrypted vault data is never accessed, viewed, or used by us. The App operates under a zero-knowledge architecture, meaning encryption and decryption occur only on your device, and we do not possess your master password or encryption keys.\n\nWe do not use your data for advertising purposes, and we do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties.\n\nData Security\n\nSecurity is a fundamental part of the Service. We use strong, industry-standard encryption methods to protect your data both at rest and in transit. Your master password is never transmitted to us or stored on our servers, and it cannot be recovered by us if lost.\n\nWe implement technical and organizational safeguards designed to protect information against unauthorized access, loss, misuse, or alteration. While no system can guarantee absolute security, we continuously review and improve our security practices to reduce risk.\n\nYou are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your master password and for securing access to your device. If you believe your account or device has been compromised, you should take immediate steps to secure your data.\n\nCloud Sync and Backups\n\nIf you choose to enable cloud synchronization or backup features, your data is encrypted before leaving your device. Any data stored on external servers remains encrypted and unreadable without your master password. We do not have the ability to decrypt or access this data.\n\nYou may disable synchronization features at any time, and you retain control over where and how your encrypted data is stored.\n\nThird-Party Services\n\nThe App may rely on trusted third-party services for infrastructure, analytics, or crash reporting. These services may process limited technical data on our behalf, solely for providing their services and in compliance with applicable privacy and security standards. They are not permitted to access your encrypted vault data.\n\nWe are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services that you access independently through links or integrations outside of the App.\n\nData Retention\n\nWe retain personal information only for as long as necessary to provide the Service or comply with legal obligations. Encrypted vault data remains under your control and may be deleted at any time by you through the App. When you delete your data or account, associated information is removed or anonymized within a reasonable timeframe, except where retention is required by law.\n\nUser Rights and Choices\n\nDepending on your location, you may have rights regarding your personal information, including the right to access, correct, delete, or restrict processing of your data. You may exercise these rights by contacting us through the support channels provided in the App.\n\nYou may choose not to provide certain information, but doing so may limit some features of the Service.\n\nChildren’s Privacy\n\nThe Service is not intended for use by children under the age required by applicable law without parental consent. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If we become aware that such information has been collected, we will take steps to delete it promptly.\n\nChanges to This Privacy Policy\n\nWe may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the Service, legal requirements, or security practices. Any updates will be made available within the App or through other appropriate means. Continued use of the Service after changes become effective constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.\n\nContact Us\n\nIf you have questions, concerns, or requests regarding this Privacy Policy or the handling of your information, you may contact us through the support options provided in the App. We take privacy inquiries seriously and will respond within a reasonable timeframe.\n")
